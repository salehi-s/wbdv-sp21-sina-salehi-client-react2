<h3>Home (Course Manager)</h3>

The home page presents all courses stored on the server as a table by default.
Enter the name of a new course to be added to the Course Table and Course Grid
in the input field at the top of the page and click the red plus button to the
right of this input field to add a new course to the Course Table and Course
Grid with the text entered in the input field as the title of the course, the user
as the owner of the course, and the current date and time as the date last modified
and time last modified respectively.

<h3>Course Grid</h3>

The Course Grid displays all of the courses stored on the server as a grid of
cards.  Each card details the title of the course, the owner of the course, and the
date and time at which the course was last modified.  Click the button labeled "Go
to X", in which "X" is the title of the course, to navigate to the Course Editor.
Click the trash can icon to delete the course corresponding to that card from the
server.  Click the pencil/paper icon to edit the title of the course corresponding
to that card.  Clicking this icon transforms the course title at the top of the card
to an input field.  Enter the new title of the course in this input field and click
the check mark icon that replaced the pencil/paper icon to modify the title of the
course to the text entered in the input field.

<h3>Course Table</h3>

The Course Table displays all of the courses stored on the server as a table.
Each row details the title of the course, the owner of the course, and the

to navigate to the Course Editor.  Click the trash can icon to delete the course
from the server.  Click the pencil/paper icon to edit the title of the course.
Clicking this icon transforms the course title at the front of the row
to an input field.  Enter the new title of the course in this input field and click
the check mark icon that replaced the pencil/paper icon to modify the title of the
course to the text entered in the input field.

<h3>Course Editor</h3>

The Course Editor consists of four main sections: Modules, Lessons, Topics, and Widgets.
If a module is not selected, you will not be able to view or add lessons, topics, or widgets.
If a lesson is not selected, you will not be able to view or add topics or widgets.
If a topic is not selected, you will not be able to view or add widgets.
Click the plus icon under Modules to add a new module with the title "New Module"
to the list of modules.  After selecting a module, click the plus icon under Lessons
to add a new lesson with the title "New Lesson" to the list of lessons.  After selecting
a lesson, click the plus icon under Topics to add a new topic with the title "New
Topic" to the list of topics.  After selecting a topic, click the plus icon to the right of
Widgets List to add a new widget with the type "HEADING", the size 1, and the text "Widget Text"
to the list of widgets.  Widgets are specific to their corresponding topics, topics are
specific to their corresponding lessons, lessons are specific to their corresponding modules,
and modules are specific to their corresponding courses.

Widgets may be of any of the following types: heading, paragraph, list, or image.
Heading widgets display bold heading text using the heading tag corresponding to the
indicated size (e.g. a heading widget of size 3 would use h3 heading tags).
Paragraph widgets display a simple paragraph.  List widgets display an ordered list of
items if the Ordered checkbox is marked or an unordered list of items if the Ordered
checkbox is unmarked.  Image widgets display an image located at the indicated source
URL with the resolution specified by the indicated width and height.
